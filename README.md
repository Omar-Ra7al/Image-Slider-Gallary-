# Image Gallery Slider

This project is an interactive image gallery slider that provides a smooth and responsive user experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Features:

- **Icon-Based Navigation:** Users can slide images left or right using intuitive icons, making it easy to browse through the gallery.
- **Swipe Support on Mobile:** On mobile devices, users can navigate through the images by swiping, offering a seamless touch-based interaction.
- **Dynamic Spans:** The slider features dynamic spans that indicate which image is currently displayed. These spans are generated automatically based on the number of images in the gallery. Clicking on a span will navigate directly to the corresponding image.
- **Auto-Slide:** Images automatically transition every 3 seconds, providing a hands-free browsing experience.
- **Hover to Pause:** When the user hovers over the slider, the automatic image transition pauses, allowing them to focus on a particular image without interruption.
- **Easy Image Management:** Simply add your desired images to the gallery, and the spans will be created automatically, reflecting the total number of images.

This project is perfect for showcasing image collections in a visually appealing and user-friendly way, whether on a website or a mobile app.
